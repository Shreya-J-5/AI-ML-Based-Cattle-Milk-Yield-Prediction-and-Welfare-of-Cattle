#  AI/ML-Based Cattle Milk Yield and Health Prediction Platform

##  Overview
This repository provides an **AI/ML-powered Cattle Monitoring Platform** üêÆüìä that helps farmers **predict milk yield** and **detect diseases early**.  
By analyzing cattle feed, activity, environment, and health data, the platform boosts farm productivity, reduces risks, and supports data-driven dairy management.

##  Installation
## Prerequisites
Before installing and running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- Node.js and npm (for frontend/dashboard)  
- Git  

---

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Create a Python Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 4. Upgrade pip (Recommended)
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 5. Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Install Frontend Dependencies (Optional, if dashboard is included)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### 7. Run the Backend Service
```bash
# If entrypoint file is app.py
python app.py

# If using FastAPI/Uvicorn
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 8. Access the Application
- Open the frontend dashboard in your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
- Backend API (if running separately): [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Notes
- If environment variables are required, create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
- Update the `.env` file with the correct configuration values before starting the application.
