#  AI/ML-Based Cattle Milk Yield and Health Prediction Platform

##  Overview
This repository provides an **AI/ML-powered Cattle Monitoring Platform** üêÆüìä that helps farmers **predict milk yield** and **detect diseases early**.  
By analyzing cattle feed, activity, environment, and health data, the platform boosts farm productivity, reduces risks, and supports data-driven dairy management.
